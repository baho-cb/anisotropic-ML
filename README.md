Anisotropic particle simulation code with NeuroEvolutionPotential.

## Project Structure

01. **Data Generation**  
    Scripts and utilities for generating training and validation datasets for anisotropic particle systems.

02. **Comparisons with SOAP**  
    Benchmarks comparing the NeuroEvolutionPotential with the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors.

03. **Schnet vs DimeNet++**  
    Evaluation of model performance across SchNet, DimeNet++, and other graph-based neural networks.

04. **MLFlow Experiments**  
    MLFlow logging and tracking setup for training sessions and performance evaluation.

05. **MLFlow â€“ Point Placement Experiments for Twisted Cylinders**  
    Experiments investigating the effect of particle placement strategies on twisted cylindrical geometries using MLFlow.
